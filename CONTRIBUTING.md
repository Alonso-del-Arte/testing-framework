I think I will open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

I will definitely consider pull requests associated with an issue and maybe consider pull requests associated with a TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans).

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) and TestNG. This project uses Java 8. Contributors may use later versions of Java provided they don't use features not available in Java 8. No existing testing framework is to be used for this project.
