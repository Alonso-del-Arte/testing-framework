This project is open to Hacktoberfest 2021.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

I will definitely consider pull requests associated with an issue and maybe 
consider pull requests associated with a TODO (considered an Action Item in 
NetBeans).

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free), like 
Apache NetBeans. I'm actually using Eclipse for this project; since I don't like 
Eclipse's JUnit integration, I don't feel like I'm missing much.

This project uses Java 8. Contributors may use later versions of Java provided 
they don't use features not available in Java 8. No existing testing framework 
is to be used for this project.

Remember that the goal of this project isn't to replace an existing testing 
framework, or even to try to do that.

Except for `org.example.demo`, everything in `com.example` and `org.example` is 
meant to be exercises. Finished classes in those packages are not meant to be 
checked in.
