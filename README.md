# Testing Framework

The idea isn't to supplant JUnit or any other existing unit testing framework, 
but to understand how a testing framework could be created from scratch through 
test-driven development (TDD) without recourse to any existing testing 
framework.

For this project, we acknowledge the existence of frameworks like TestNG, and we 
may use ideas from those frameworks, but we won't be using them directly (except 
maybe as a formality in NetBeans to get the proper separation between Source 
Packages and Test Packages started).

For instructions on how to use this testing framework, see 
[How to Use This Framework](UserManual.md). For instructions on how to 
contribute to this project, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that although we've upgraded to Java 21, the releases 0.9 and 1.0 will most 
likely be for Java 8.
